    <title>Caribbean Jerk Chicken Meal</title>
    <p>The spirit of Jamaica's popular jerk sauce comes through in this superspicy, 
        fragrant grilled chicken. To punch up the flavor even more,
        let the marinade sit for an additional 24 hours before adding the meat. 
        To lower the heat, swap out Scotch bonnet chiles (among the world's hottest) for jalape√±os.</p>

    <h1>Jerk Chicken Recipe</h1>
    <p>Ingredients
        Ingredient Checklist
        8 scallions, chopped
        4 large garlic cloves, chopped
        3 Scotch bonnet chiles, chopped
        1 small onion, chopped 
        1/4 cup dark brown sugar
        2 tablespoons chopped thyme
        2 tablespoons ground allspice
        Salt
        1 1/4 teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg
        1 teaspoon cinnamon
        1/2 cup white vinegar
        1/4 cup soy sauce 
        1/4 cup fresh lime juice 
        1/4 cup fresh orange juice
        1/4 cup vegetable oil 
        Three 4-pound chickens, each cut into 8 pieces
        Freshly ground pepper</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Some jerk chicken is so fiery that it will wipe out any wine; 
       Tourondel's is more subtle than that. Nevertheless, it's still intensely spicy, 
       so it goes best with a fruity, not terribly tannic red that won't accentuate its heat. 
       Zinfandel is a good choice: such as one from Sonoma County or the Russian River Valley.</p>
